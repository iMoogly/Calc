# Calc
CIS 1111 Programming Topic - 8 Calculate Your Grade
(20 Points)

Description:

In this assignment, you will develop C++ and Raptor programs to input and find the average for quiz and assignment grades, then calculate the overall average and letter grade. 

Requirements:

⦁	Use variables of the appropriate type.
⦁	Use accumulators and counters.  
⦁	Use a “for” loop to input quiz grades for the user and total the four quizzes. (Quizzes are worth 10 points)
⦁	Calculate and display the quiz average
⦁	Use a while loop to input and total the eight assignments. (Assignments are worth 20 points). 
⦁	Calculate and display the average of the assignments
⦁	As the grades are inputted, check to make sure they are not negative numbers or greater than their worth.
⦁	Calculate the overall average. To do so add your quizzes and assignments totals and divide by possible points.
⦁	Use setprecision to only show the integer portion of the percentage grade. 
⦁	Use a nested if-else statement to translate your percentage to a grade.
⦁	Display the total of quizzes, assignments, percentages, and letter grade.
⦁	Flowchart the program in Raptor.

Sample output:

⦁	Screen shots of your code and output
⦁	The Raptor program
⦁	Screenshots of your Raptor program and output
